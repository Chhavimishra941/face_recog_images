# face_recog_images
In this code, we recognise images from a set of trained images. The harrcascade and lpbcascade code should be placed in opencv-files folder and training-set and testing-set folders should be created. The list in code should be modified bsed on the names of individuals in the images provided and the OpenCV code should be run.
